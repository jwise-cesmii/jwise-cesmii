### Greetings!

I'm Jonathan, and I've been involved with manufacturing information systems, analytics and bridging the OT/IT divide for more than 20 years. Today we call this "smart manufacturing" or "Industry 4.0" and I work with some of the organizations leading the charge, including [CESMII - The Smart Manufacturing Institute](https://www.cesmii.org). CESMII is the United States' national institute focused on this space, and is run as a department of UCLA's Office of Advanced Research computing.

Among other things, we advocate for open and common technologies, standards, and best practices that can help everyone do manufacturing smarter and more efficiently.
