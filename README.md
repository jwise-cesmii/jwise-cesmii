### Greetings!

I'm Jonathan, and I've been involved with manufacturing information systems, analytics and bridging the OT/IT divide for more than 20 years. Today we call this "smart manufacturing" or "Industry 4.0" and I work with some of the organizations leading the charge, including the [OPC Foundation](https://www.opcfoundation.org) and [CESMII - The Smart Manufacturing Institute](https://www.cesmii.org). CESMII is the United States' national institute focused on this space, and is a department of UCLA's Office of Advanced Research computing.

Among other things, I advocate for open and common technologies, standards, and best practices that can help everyone do manufacturing smarter and more efficiently.
